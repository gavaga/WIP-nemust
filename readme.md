# NEmuSt

NEmuSt is a NES emulator build in pure rust. It's open-source and licensed under the MIT license.

This has been built primarily as an exercise, and is therefore unmaintained. You are welcome to download it, play around with it, fork it, or whatever. You're also welcome to open Github issues with bug reports, or feature suggestions, either of which may possibly be helpful or interesting to me, but I make no promises about resolving them. Pull requests will also generally be ignored, given the nature of the project as a personal exercise.
